# Loan-Approval-Prediction
## Overview
This project aims to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not based on various factors such as the applicant's income, loan amount, and credit history. It uses machine learning techniques to analyze the data and make accurate predictions.

## Key Features
- Data Processing: Cleaned and preprocessed data for accurate model training.
- Model Training: Used machine learning algorithms to predict loan approval status.
- Evaluation: Tested and evaluated the model using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
- Visualization: Created visualizations to better understand the data and model results.

## Project Structure
- data/: Contains the dataset used for training the model.
- notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with the detailed analysis and model building.
- scripts/: Python scripts used for data preprocessing and model evaluation.
- results/: Output of the model and performance metrics.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results
The model was able to achieve a good accuracy in predicting loan approval based on historical data. It can be further improved by tuning the model and using more advanced algorithms.

## Future Work
- Implement advanced machine learning models for better accuracy.
- Add more features to improve predictions.
- Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit for real-time loan approval predictions.
